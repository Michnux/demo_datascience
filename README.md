Implementation of 2 custom anaytics on the Alteia Platform

- run_yolov5
- train_yolov5

Both analytics call one unique docker (yv5:latest) on dockerhub.
Based on the parameters discovered in the input.json file, the main function run on of 2 scripts: run.py or train.py


* run_yolov5

run_yolov5 allows you to select on .pt (yolov5/torch weight files) file and run it on the current survey.

The .pt file can be uploaded directly as a file on the platform, with the type:file and the category:object detection or it can be generated by the train_yolov5 analytics.

The results is a series of annotations that are made on each pics of the current survey.

Additionnaly, the analytics issues a pdf report with a few informations about the results.


* train_yolov5

train_yolov5 allows you train the yolov5 from the current annotated survey.

Annotations should be in the box format.

A .pt shall be selected at startup as an initialisation of the weights to be trained.

The result is a .pt file (category: object detection) that can be subsequently used in the run_yolov5 analytics
